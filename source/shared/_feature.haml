  %h2 Problem Statement
  %p We have observed that Apps Manager isn’t helping developers to provision (create) services quickly which is causing confusion and improper provisioning. How might we improve the service provision flow to reduce confusion.

  %h2 Background
  %p Cloud Foundry is built for cloud native 12 factor applications that fit into a microservices architecture. Services are a part of the microservices architecture and provisioning (creating) a new service is a common action. A service supports your application and can, for example, be a database of customer information, a message broker, or an email delivery client.

  %h2 The Plan
  %ul
    %li Define problem/build context
    %li Write out scenarios (need, action, feedback, responses)
    %li Sketching/Wireframing
    %li Visuals (Sketch)
    %li Prototype and validate (Invision or HTML)
    %li Ship it/Measure it

  %h2 Scenario writing
  %p There are three ways a developer might provision a service in the UI today. In the context of an app, a space, or directly from the marketplace. Writing scenarios with the team for each of these flows was a great way to flesh out the flow and have a conversation about constraints and expectations without getting caught up on visuals.
  %p.mbn Scenario Format:

    %li
      %i Need

      %i Action

      %i Feedback
    %li
      %i Response
    %li
      %i Repeat until goal achieved

  %h2 Sketching / Wireframing
  %p Having a shared understanding of the 3 scenarios clearly laid out it was time to go wide with some different ideas for what this could look like. I started with sketching on post-it notes and using them to frame up a basic storyboard. This helped me to visually see which flow could cut down on steps and keep me from getting too detailed yet.

    .img-subtitle Post-it storyboard user flows
  %p Next I sketched on my iPad using the Concepts app to quickly iterate through a chosen visual flow. This is what I'll walk through with my PM and lead engineer to ensure I’m moving in the right direction.

  %h2 Visuals
  %p This particular flow is pretty easy on the visuals and more difficult on the interactions. I had a bunch of reusable sketch bits that fit to our design framework so the visuals came together easily. I stitched together an InVision flow and used that to do some basic validation with users and the team that I was still moving in the right direction.

  %h2 Prototype
  %p The flow was starting to come together visually but I was still nervous about the interaction feeling awkward. I jumped into an HTML mock-up with just enough jQuery to fake the touch points. Click on the link below and click on the “Add A Service” button to start the flow and select the "ElephantSQL" service from the list. Please note that this is not a full app prototype and there are many rough edges if you start to stray.

  %p This worked great for aligning on the engineering, product, and design of this feature. Usability testing an HTML mock-up helps to drive out all of the quirky little edge cases that you would never catch working in Sketch. I was reminded to watch for long lists of content and wide lines of text. Feeling the animations and interacting with the content helps to drive out quality feedback from usability sessions.
  %h2 Ship It
  %p
    My engineers now have an InVision prototype and an HTML prototype to build from. I don't usually bother with redlining because the
    %a{:href => "#design-system"} PUI design system
    is opinionated about spacing and contains a number of reusable patterns. At most I'll call out a few components and colors but the engineers can usually get the design 90% of the way there and I'll come in at the end to give feedback for the final 10%.
  %h2 Measure
  %p
    This feature has been freshly shipped. On
    %a{:href => "http://run.pivotal.io/"} Pivotal Web Services
    we’ve been able to track and measure user engagement with the new flow and continue to gather feedback from ongoing user research. PCF customers will receive this in the 1.12 update that is now available.
